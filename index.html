         <h1>1<sup>st</sup> International Workshop on Models for Simulation (M4S) 2024</h1>
         <h3>December 3, 2024, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden, co-located with <a href="https://poem2024.dsv.su.se">PoEM 2024</a></h3>
         <hr />
         <p>
            Simulation capitalizes on structural, behavioral, and physical models. They 
            embody the fundamental concepts of a system, whereas simulation actualizes those
            principles in a dynamic setting. The modeling community is facing new issues
            in terms of authenticity, trustworthiness, and sensitivity of models due to the
            increasing popularity of digital twins which in turn capitalize on models as one
            of their fundamental pillars next to the physical twin, and bidirectional data
            exchange between the physical and virtual world. In socioeconomic systems,
            additional challenges emerge as some characteristics of these systems are only
            partially observable by sensors and require innovative ways of modeling. Models 
            and simulations are effective instruments for comprehending, examining, and
            forecasting the behavior of intricate systems in several fields. To fully maximize
            these advantages, a thorough reassessment of the fitness of models for simulation
            is necessary.
         </p>
         <p>Our workshop targets the following objectives:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Elicit the current state and readiness of system and software models for use in digital twin-based simulation.</li>
            <li>Identify core scenarios and, from these, essential model requirements for digital-twin-based simulation.</li>
            <li>Outline the main areas of study that need to be addressed in the near future to ensure that system and 
              software models are suitable for simulations of cyber-physical and socioeconomic systems and processes 
              based on digital twins.</li>
         </ul>
