         <p>
            The intersection of software engineering and simulation engineering presents 
            transformative opportunities for automation, efficiency, and innovation. This 
            workshop aims to explore the bidirectional impact between these domains, focusing 
            on automating simulation engineering through advanced software methodologies and 
            simulation-driven software engineering for enhanced testing, validation, and decision-making. 
            Bringing together researchers, industry professionals, and developers, the workshop 
            will foster discussions on cutting-edge methodologies, challenges, and tools that 
            enhance simulation workflows and software automation. Key topics include model-driven 
            engineering for simulations, AI-driven tuning, continuous integration for simulation, 
            simulation-based software testing, digital twins, and cross-domain interoperability.
            Participants will gain insights into emerging trends, best practices, and collaborative 
            opportunities that drive advancements in cyber-physical systems, autonomous technologies, 
            and AI-driven simulations.
